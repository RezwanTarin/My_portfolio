                RE:Full Stack Software Developer<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear hiring manager,<br>
            I am writing to apply for a position on software developer team at <b>name of company</b>. 
            in Toronto office, as advertised on your company website. 
            I have been in computer programming for almost three years, 
            working with different languages. I am confident that my skills and academic 
            background make me and ideal candidate for this position. 
            This opportunity will allow me to utilize my expertise and knowledge in a 
            setting where I can make a positive contrition.
        </p>

        <p>
            As stated in my resume, I have a variety of knowledge in different languages.  
            Such as react native, DevOps, machine learning, IOS and Android mobile application 
            C#, ASP .NET Core, Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Python, HTML, and CSS. 
            I am comfortable working with C#, ASP .Net. 
            Right now, I am working in my capstone project and we are building a 
            multiplatform for a company name Geeazy.com. 
            In this project we are using react native to develop this application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a project in SQL last semester in a group as well, 
            and we were successful with our project. 
            Each member was assigned to do a task each day for almost two weeks, 
            and we would have meetings for half an hour to talk about the process 
            and where we currently are and share our ideas for the project. 
            Also, I did a project in System Analysis and Design (SAD). 
            It was a project where I had to build a web application for a company, 
            and It took one month to complete that project. 
            From these projects I got familiarized with the language 
            I used and working in a  group.    
        </p>
        <p>
            My experiences have taught me to perform multiple tasks effectively 
            in a fast-paced professional workplace, while maintaining confidentiality 
            with sensitive information and materials. I have experience managing, 
            leading projects, and satisfying a diverse group of clients, 
            both of which require strong interpersonal and communication skills. 
            Besides being a quick learner, I easily adapt to any kind of working 
            environment. My commitment to excellent work standards and work ethics 
            will add value to your team, as will my positive attitude, motivation 
            and energy.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any further questions, I can be reached at 
            <b>(phone number)</b> or rezwantarin2016@gmail.com. 
            Thank you for your time and consideration. 
            I look forward to meeting you in the near future. 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Sincerely Yours,<br>
